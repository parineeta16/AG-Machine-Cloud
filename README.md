# AG-Machine-Cloud

A Cloud-Based Agriculture Machine Service Platform (AG-Machine-Cloud) is a system designed for transportation of agricultural products. The goal of the system is to maintain flexibility, safety and affordability.
Agriculture is one of the largest sectors in the United States. About 40% of US land is used for agriculture.
Research demonstrates that farmers and ranchers receive only 15 cents out of every dollar spent on food at home and abroad. The rest is required for processing, marketing, materials for production, distribution and transportation.
Hence, a system with reasonable rates as well as access is required for the transportation of agricultural products.
